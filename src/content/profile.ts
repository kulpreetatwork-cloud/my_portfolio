  // Bio
  bio: {
    short: "Final-year B.Tech student specializing in AI, passionate about building scalable full-stack applications that solve real-world problems.",
    long: `I'm a Computer Science student at G.L Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My journey in tech is driven by a passion for creating impactful software solutions that combine elegant design with robust functionality.

With hands-on experience in the MERN stack, I've built production-ready applications like WealthWise (an AI-powered finance platform) and ChatPulse (a real-time chat application). I thrive on challenges that push me to learn new technologies and implement best practices.

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with talented teams, and continue growing as a developer. Whether it's building AI-integrated systems, designing responsive interfaces, or architecting scalable backends — I'm ready to dive in and make an impact.`
